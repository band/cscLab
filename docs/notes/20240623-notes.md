# 2024-05-23 notes

1. experimenting with openLib.py:  
 - openlibrary json search works, but information returned on books
   found does *not* contain any web link information (wha?)  
 - will explore Google book search next.  
 
2. able to take PK's recent books found in call list and use that
   information to query openlibrary  
   (also create and format an APA style citation, FWIW)  

3. first working version of searching Google books  

4. FEATURE REQUEST: return a web-link for every book, even if it is
   only a landing page for a publisher.  
   - perhaps try to use openlibrary goodreads_id's and others to get
     landing pages?  
	 
   - this really is a fool's errand. the metadata is not open, or easy
     to access.
